    This folder contains data and analysis for finding the nearest neighbour distances (nnd) of amino acids in individual proteins, using Voronoi partitioning, also the distribution of sequential side-chain and backbone C_alpha distances in individual proteins.
    
    Finally, clusters of amino acids will be identified according to some criterion.  All of this is done for the purpose of identifying the underlying mechanism that gives rise to the best WCN definition with power-law exponent of ~ -2.
