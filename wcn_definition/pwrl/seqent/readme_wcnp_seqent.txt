In this set of codes, I tried to investigate the effects of varying the exponent (alpha=-2) in the default definition of WCN for each pdb file on the strength of the correlation between WCN and residue sequence entropies of Echave dataset, calculated by Eleisha Jackson. It might be interesing to compare these results to those obtained from comparing WCN and CA-bfactor correlation strengths and see to what extent the two derived exponents agree with each other.
