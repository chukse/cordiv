	abstract = {Elastic network models (ENMs) are entropic models that have demonstrated in many previous studies their abilities to capture overall the important internal motions, with comparisons having been made against crystallographic B-factors and NMR conformational variabilities. ENMs have become an increasingly important tool and have been widely used to comprehend protein dynamics, function, and even conformational changes. However, reliance upon an arbitrary cutoff distance to delimit the range of interactions has presented a drawback for these models, because the optimal cutoff values can differ somewhat from protein to protein and can lead to quirks such as some shuffling in the order of the normal modes when applied to structures that differ only slightly. Here, we have replaced the requirement for a cutoff distance and introduced the more physical concept of inverse power dependence for the interactions, with a set of elastic network models that are parameter-free, with the distance cutoff removed. For small fluctuations about the native forms, the power dependence is the inverse square, but for larger deformations, the power dependence may become inverse 6th or 7th power. These models maintain and enhance the simplicity and generality of the original ENMs, and at the same time yield better predictions of crystallographic B-factors (both isotropic and anisotropic) and of the directions of conformational transitions. Thus, these parameter-free ENMs can be models of choice whenever elastic network models are used.},

Here, packing refers to the set of all pairs of atoms in the molecule. Among all methods developed to assess three-dimensional models, statistical potentials are subject both to praise for their power of discrimination, and to criticism for the weaknesses of their theoretical foundations. Classical derivations of pairwise potentials assume statistical independence of all pairs of atoms. This assumption, however, is not valid in general. We show that we can filter the list of all interactions in a protein to generate a much smaller subset of pairs that retains most of the structural information contained in proteins. The filter is based on a geometric method called alpha shapes that captures the packing in a conformation. Statistical scoring functions derived from such subsets perform as well as scoring functions derived from the set of all pairwise interactions.},

	abstract = {Elastic network models (ENM) are based on the idea that the geometry of a protein structure provides enough information for computing its fluctuations around its equilibrium conformation. This geometry is represented as an elastic network (EN) that is, a network of links between residues. A spring is associated with each of these links. The normal modes of the protein are then identified with the normal modes of the corresponding network of springs. Standard approaches for generating ENs rely on a cutoff distance. There is no consensus on how to choose this cutoff. In this work, we propose instead to filter the set of all residue pairs in a protein using the concept of alpha shapes. The main alpha shape we considered is based on the Delaunay triangulation of the Cα positions; we referred to the corresponding EN as EN(∞). We have shown that heterogeneous anisotropic network models, called αHANMs, that are based on EN(∞) reproduce experimental B-factors very well, with correlation coefficients above 0.99 and root-mean-square deviations below 0.1 Å2 for a large set of high resolution protein structures. The construction of EN(∞) is simple to implement and may be used automatically for generating ENs for all types of ENMs. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

A simplex classification scheme is introduced in which simplices are divided into five classes based on the relative positions of vertex residues in the protein primary sequence.

	abstract = {In protein evolution, due to functional and biophysical constraints, the rates of amino acid substitution differ from site to site. Among the best predictors of site-specific rates are solvent accessibility and packing density. The packing density measure that best correlates with rates is the weighted contact number (WCN), the sum of inverse square distances between a site’s Cα and the Cα of the other sites. According to a mechanistic stress model proposed recently, rates are determined by packing because mutating packed sites stresses and destabilizes the protein’s active conformation. While WCN is a measure of Cα packing, mutations replace side chains. Here, we consider whether a site’s evolutionary divergence is constrained by main-chain packing or side-chain packing. To address this issue, we extended the stress theory to model side chains explicitly. The theory predicts that rates should depend solely on side-chain contact density. We tested this prediction on a data set of structurally and functionally diverse monomeric enzymes. We compared side-chain contact density with main-chain contact density measures and with relative solvent accessibility (RSA). We found that side-chain contact density is the best predictor of rate variation among sites (it explains 39.2\% of the variation). Moreover, the independent contribution of main-chain contact density measures and RSA are negligible. Thus, as predicted by the stress theory, site-specific evolutionary rates are determined by side-chain packing.},

	abstract = {The concept of amino acid solvent exposure is crucial for understanding and predicting various aspects of protein structure and function. The traditional measures of solvent exposure however suffer from various shortcomings, like for example the inability to distinguish exposed, partly exposed, buried, and deeply buried residues. This article introduces a new measure of solvent exposure called Half-Sphere Exposure that addresses many of the shortcomings of other methods. The new measure outperforms other measures with respect to correlation with protein stability, conservation among fold homologs, amino acid-type dependency and interpretation. The measure consists of the number of Cα atoms in two half spheres around a residue's Cα atom. Conceptually, one of the half spheres corresponds to the side chain's neighborhood, the other half sphere being in the opposite direction. We show here that the two half spheres correspond to two regions around an amino acid that are surprisingly distinct in terms of geometry and energy. This aspect of protein structure introduced here forms the basis of the Half-Sphere Exposure measure. The results strongly suggest that in many respects, a 2D measure is inherently much better suited to describe solvent exposure than the traditional 1D measures. Importantly, Half-Sphere Exposure can be calculated from the Cα atom coordinates only, which abolishes the need for a full-atom model to calculate solvent exposure. Hence, the measure can be used in protein structure prediction methods that are based on various simplified models. Half-Sphere Exposure has great potential for use in protein structure prediction and analysis. Proteins 2005. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

It is commonly assumed that the key structural determinant of site-specific rates of evolution is the Relative Solvent Accessibility (RSA). However, a recent study found that amino acid substitution rates correlate better with two Local Packing Density (LPD) measures, the Weighted Contact Number (WCN) and the Contact Number (CN), than with RSA. This work aims at a more thorough assessment. To this end, in addition to substitution rates, we considered four other sequence variability scores, four measures of solvent accessibility (SA), and other CN measures. We compared all properties for each protein of a structurally and functionally diverse representative dataset of monomeric enzymes. We show that the best sequence variability measures take into account phylogenetic tree topology. More importantly, we show that both LPD measures (WCN and CN) correlate better than all of the SA measures, regardless of the sequence variability score used. Moreover, the independent contribution of the best LPD measure is approximately four times larger than that of the best SA measure. This study strongly supports the conclusion that a site\&\#x2019;s packing density rather than its solvent accessibility is the main structural determinant of its rate of evolution.},

Although proteins look like organic crystals by the criterion of average density, they look more like liquids and glasses by the criterion of their free volume distributions. The distributions are broad, and the scalings of volume-to-surface, volume-to-cluster-radius, and numbers of void versus volume show that the interiors of proteins are more like randomly packed spheres near their percolation threshold than like jigsaw puzzles. We find that larger proteins are packed more loosely than smaller proteins.

Although these properties are inherently quantitative, structure-based studies of protein evolution tend to rely upon coarse distinctions between “surface” and “buried” residues and between “interfacial” and “noninterfacial” residues. Using homology-mapped yeast protein structures, we explore the relationships between residue evolution and continuous structural properties of the residue microenvironment, including solvent accessibility, density and distribution of residue–residue contacts, and burial depth. We confirm the role of solvent exposure as a major structural determinant of residue evolution and also identify a weak secondary effect arising from packing density. The relationship between solvent exposure and evolutionary rate (dN/dS) is found to be strong, positive, and linear. This reinforces the notion that residue burial is a continuous property with quantitative fitness implications. Next, we demonstrate systematic variation in residue-level structure–evolution relationships resulting from changes in global physical and biological contexts. We find that increasing protein-core size yields a more rapid relaxation of selective constraint as solvent exposure increases, although solvent-excluded residues remain similarly constrained. Finally, we analyze the selective constraint in protein–protein interfaces, revealing two fundamentally different yet separable components: continuous structural constraint that scales with total residue burial and a more surprising fixed functional constraint that accompanies any degree of interface involvement. These discoveries serve to elucidate and unite structure–evolution relationships at the residue and whole-protein levels.},

The variation of the whole core is very small (∼2·5\%) compared to the variation at individual sites (∼ 13\%). However, by comparing our results to those expected from random sequences with no correlations between sites,, we show that the small variation observed may simply be a manifestation of the statistical “law of large numbers” and not reflect any compensating changes in, or global constraints upon, protein sequences.

We have also analysed in detail the volume variations at individual sites, both in the core and on the surface, and compared these variations with those expected from random sequences. Individual sites on the surface have nearly the same variation as random sequences (24\% versus 28\% variation). However, individual sites in the core have about half the variation of random sequences (13\% versus 30\%). Roughly, half of these core sites strongly conserve their volume (0 to 10\% variation): one quarter have moderate variation (10 to 20\%): and the remaining quarter vary randomly (20 to 40\%).

Our results have clear implications for the relationship between protein sequence and structure. For our analysis, we have developed a new and simple method for weighting protein sequences to correct for unequal representation, which we describe in an Appendix.},

It is suggested that simple geometrical packing considerations may provide useful criteria in guiding and evaluating trial structures in theoretical studies of protein folding, especially the association of distant parts of a peptide chain.

Packing densities averaged over a relatively small number of atoms (5 to 15) appear to vary substantially in different parts of the same protein. Low densities representing packing defects may permit relatively easy motions, for example in an active site. Surrounding areas of high density may serve as relatively incompressible regions which transmit or correlate motions over considerable distances.

The total volume of each of these two proteins as derived from the co-ordinate list appears to be larger than that estimated from the partial specific volume by 7 to 10\%. If this volume difference is attributed to a change in the packing of water in a monolayer surrounding the protein, it would correspond to an average decrease, relative to bulk water, of 1 to 2 Å3 per water molecule in this monolayer. Such a change is about half of the decrease that occurs on the melting of ice.},

	abstract = {Structural flexibility is an essential attribute, without which few proteins could carry out their biological functions. Much information about protein flexibility has come from x-ray crystallography, in the form of atomic mean-square displacements (AMSDs) or B factors. Profiles showing the AMSD variation along the polypeptide chain are usually interpreted in dynamical terms but are ultimately governed by the local features of a highly complex energy landscape. Here, we bypass this complexity by showing that the AMSD profile is essentially determined by spatial variations in local packing density. On the basis of elementary statistical mechanics and generic features of atomic distributions in proteins, we predict a direct inverse proportionality between the AMSD and the contact density, i.e., the number of noncovalent neighbor atoms within a local region of ∼1.5 nm3 volume. Testing this local density model against a set of high-quality crystal structures of 38 nonhomologous proteins, we find that it accurately and consistently reproduces the prominent peaks in the AMSD profile and even captures minor features, such as the periodic AMSD variation within α helices. The predicted rigidifying effect of crystal contacts also agrees with experimental data. With regard to accuracy and computational efficiency, the model is clearly superior to its predecessors. The quantitative link between flexibility and packing density found here implies that AMSDs provide little independent information beyond that contained in the mean atomic coordinates.},

We then develop a model on the basis of observed site-specific amino acid distributions and show that this model behaves appropriately. We conclude that evolutionary rates are directly linked to the distribution of amino acids at individual sites.

Surprisingly, there is no correlation between the overall selective constraint observed for a protein alignment and the ratio of constraints on interior and surface residues. By modeling the selective constraint on several amino acid properties, we show that although residue volume and hydropathy are strongly conserved across most alignments, there is little variation in interior versus surface conservation for these two properties. By contrast, residue charge (isoelectric point) is less generally conserved when considering the protein as a whole but shows a strong constraint against the introduction of charged residues into the protein interior.},

Significant association between secondary structure environment and the amino acid replacement process is also observed. Careful description of the length distribution of secondary structure elements and of the organization of secondary structure and solvent accessibility along a protein did not always significantly improve the fit of the evolutionary models to the data sets that were analyzed.

In this paper, we analyzed five enzymes for which polymorphic sequence variation within Escherichia coli and/or Salmonella enterica was available, along with a protein structure. Single and multivariate logistic regression models are presented that evaluate amino acid size, physicochemical properties, solvent accessibility, and secondary structure as predictors of polymorphism. A model that contains a positive coefficient of association between polymorphism and solvent accessibility and separate intercepts for each secondary-structure element is sufficient to explain the observed variation in polymorphism between sites. The model predicts an increase in the probability of amino acid polymorphism with increasing solvent accessibility for each protein regardless of physicochemical properties, secondary-structure element, or size of the amino acid. This result, when compared with the distribution of synonymous polymorphism, which shows no association with solvent accessibility, suggests a strong decrease in purifying selection with increasing solvent accessibility.},

In particular, sites that are buried and/or have many contacts with other sites in a structure have been shown to evolve more slowly, on average, than surface sites with few contacts. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the extent to which numerous structural properties can predict sequence variation. The quantities we considered include buriedness (as measured by relative solvent accessibility), packing density (as measured by contact number), structural flexibility (as measured by B factors, root-mean-square fluctuations, and variation in dihedral angles), and variability in designed structures. We obtained structural flexibility measures both from molecular dynamics simulations performed on nine non-homologous viral protein structures and from variation in homologous variants of those proteins, where they were available. We obtained measures of variability in designed structures from flexible-backbone design in the Rosetta software. We found that most of the structural properties correlate with site variation in the majority of structures, though the correlations are generally weak (correlation coefficients of 0.1–0.4). Moreover, we found that buriedness and packing density were better predictors of evolutionary variation than structural flexibility. Finally, variability in designed structures was a weaker predictor of evolutionary variability than buriedness or packing density, but it was comparable in its predictive power to the best structural flexibility measures. We conclude that simple measures of buriedness and packing density are better predictors of evolutionary variation than the more complicated predictors obtained from dynamic simulations, ensembles of homologous structures, or computational protein design.},

	abstract = {The relative solvent accessibility (RSA) of a residue in a protein measures the extent of burial or exposure of that residue in the 3D structure. RSA is frequently used to describe a protein's biophysical or evolutionary properties. To calculate RSA, a residue's solvent accessibility (ASA) needs to be normalized by a suitable reference value for the given amino acid; several normalization scales have previously been proposed. However, these scales do not provide tight upper bounds on ASA values frequently observed in empirical crystal structures. Instead, they underestimate the largest allowed ASA values, by up to 20\%. As a result, many empirical crystal structures contain residues that seem to have RSA values in excess of one. Here, we derive a new normalization scale that does provide a tight upper bound on observed ASA values. We pursue two complementary strategies, one based on extensive analysis of empirical structures and one based on systematic enumeration of biophysically allowed tripeptides. Both approaches yield congruent results that consistently exceed published values. We conclude that previously published ASA normalization values were too small, primarily because the conformations that maximize ASA had not been correctly identified. As an application of our results, we show that empirically derived hydrophobicity scales are sensitive to accurate RSA calculation, and we derive new hydrophobicity scales that show increased correlation with experimentally measured scales.},

We develop a random-effects likelihood sites model in which rate classes are RSA dependent. The RSA dependence is modeled with linear functions. We demonstrate that our RSA-dependent model provides a significantly better fit to molecular sequence data than does a traditional, RSA-independent model. We further show that our model provides a natural, RSA-dependent neutral baseline for the evolutionary rate ratio ω = dN/dS Sites that deviate from this neutral baseline likely experience selection pressure for function. We apply our method to the influenza proteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. For hemagglutinin, our method recovers positively selected sites near the sialic acid-binding site and negatively selected sites that may be important for trimerization. For neuraminidase, our method recovers the oseltamivir resistance site and otherwise suggests that few sites deviate from the neutral baseline.

Protein structure explains only 20–40\% of the variation in ω.

Our basic hypothesis is that proteins with highly designable structures (structures that are encoded by many sequences) will evolve more rapidly. Recent theoretical advances argue that structures with a higher density of interresidue contacts are more designable, and we show that high contact density is correlated with an increased rate of sequence evolution in yeast. In addition, we investigate the correlations between the rate of sequence evolution and several other structural descriptors, carefully controlling for the strong effect of expression level on evolutionary rate. Overall, we find that the structural descriptors that we consider appear to explain roughly 10\% of the variation in rates of protein evolution in yeast. We also show that despite the well-known trend for buried residues to be more conserved, proteins with a higher fraction of buried residues, nonetheless, tend to evolve their sequences more rapidly. We suggest that this effect is due to the increased designability of structures with more buried residues. Our results provide evidence that protein structure plays an important role in shaping the rate of sequence evolution and provide evidence to support recent theoretical advances linking structural designability to contact density.},

For the accompanying aggregate set of 130 alignments, a strong linear correlation is observed between the calculated sequence entropy and the corresponding inverse packing density determined at an associated residue position. This region of linearity spans the range of Cα packing densities from 12 to 25 amino acids within a sphere of 9 Å radius. Three different hydrophobicity scales all mimic the behavior of the sequence entropies. This confirms the idea that the ability to accommodate mutations is strongly dependent on the available space and on the propensity for each amino acid type to be buried.

	abstract = {It has recently been shown that in proteins the atomic mean-square displacement (or B-factor) can be related to the number of the neighboring atoms (or protein contact number), and that this relationship allows one to compute the B-factor profiles directly from protein contact number. This method, referred to as the protein contact model, is appealing, since it requires neither trajectory integration nor matrix diagonalization. As a result, the protein contact model can be applied to very large proteins and can be implemented as a high-throughput computational tool to compute atomic fluctuations in proteins. Here, we show that this relationship can be further refined to that between the atomic mean-square displacement and the weighted protein contact-number, the weight being the square of the reciprocal distance between the contacting pair. In addition, we show that this relationship can be utilized to compute the cross-correlation of atomic motion (the B-factor is essentially the auto-correlation of atomic motion). For a nonhomologous dataset comprising 972 high-resolution X-ray protein structures (resolution {\textless}2.0 Å and sequence identity {\textless}25\%), the mean correlation coefficient between the X-ray and computed B-factors based on the weighted protein contact-number model is 0.61, which is better than those of the original contact-number model (0.51) and other methods. We also show that the computed correlation maps based on the weighted contact-number model are globally similar to those computed through normal model analysis for some selected cases. Our results underscore the relationship between protein dynamics and protein packing. We believe that our method will be useful in the study of the protein structure-dynamics relationship.

	abstract = {Biochemical activity and core stability are essential properties of proteins, maintained usually by conserved amino acids. Structural dynamics emerged in recent years as another essential aspect of protein functionality. Structural dynamics enable the adaptation of the protein to binding substrates and to undergo allosteric transitions, while maintaining the native fold. Key residues that mediate structural dynamics would thus be expected to be conserved or exhibit coevolutionary patterns at least. Yet, the correlation between sequence evolution and structural dynamics is yet to be established. With recent advances in efficient characterization of structural dynamics, we are now in a position to perform a systematic analysis. In the present study, a set of 34 enzymes representing various folds and functional classes is analyzed using information theory and elastic network models. Our analysis shows that the structural regions distinguished by their coevolution propensity as well as high mobility are predisposed to serve as substrate recognition sites, whereas residues acting as global hinges during collective dynamics are often supported by conserved residues. We propose a mobility scale for different types of amino acids, which tends to vary inversely with amino acid conservation. Our findings suggest the balance between physical adaptability (enabled by structure-encoded motions) and chemical specificity (conferred by correlated amino acid substitutions) underlies the selection of a relatively small set of versatile folds by proteins.},

	abstract = {In order to study structural aspects of sequence conservation in families of homologous proteins, we have analyzed structurally aligned sequences of 585 proteins grouped into 128 homologous families. The conservation of a residue in a family is defined as the average residue similarity in a given position of aligned sequences. The residue similarities were expressed in the form of log-odd substitution tables that take into account the environments of amino acids in three-dimensional structures. The protein core is defined as those residues that have less then 7\% solvent accessibility. The density of a protein core is described in terms of atom packing, which is investigated as a criterion for residue substitution and conservation. Although there is no significant correlation between sequence conservation and average atom packing around nonpolar residues such as leucine, valine and isoleucine, a significant correlation is observed for polar residues in the protein core. This may be explained by the hydrogen bonds in which polar residues are involved; the better their protection from water access the more stable should be the structure in that position.

For protein sequences, the sum has up to 20 terms, for nucleotide sequences, up to 4 terms, and for codon sequences, up to 61 terms. We compare S and VS, a related measure, in detail with VK, the traditional measure of immunoglobulin sequence variability, both in the abstract and as applied to the immunoglobulins. We conclude that S has desirable mathematical properties that VK lacks and has intuitive and statistical meanings that accord well with the notion of variability. We find that VK and the S-based measures are highly correlated for the immunoglobulins. We show by analysis of sequence data and by means of a mathematical model that this correlation is due to a strong tendency for the frequency of occurrence of amino acid types at a given position to be log-linear. It is not known whether the immunoglobulins are typical or atypical of protein families in this regard, nor is the origin of the observed rank-frequency distribution obvious, although we discuss several possible etiologies.},

Generating the conservation profile of a sequence requires aligning families of homologous sequences and having knowledge of their evolutionary relationships. Here, we report that the conservation profile at the residue level can be quantitatively derived from a single protein structure with only backbone information. We found that the reciprocal packing density profiles of protein structures closely resemble their sequence conservation profiles. For a set of 554 nonhomologous enzymes, 74\% (408/554) of the proteins have a correlation coefficient {\textgreater} 0.5 between these two profiles. Our results indicate that the three-dimensional structure, instead of being a mere scaffold for positioning amino acid residues, exerts such strong evolutionary constraints on the residues of the protein that its profile of sequence conservation essentially reflects that of its structural characteristics.

	abstract = {The study of molecular evolution at the level of protein-coding genes often entails comparing large datasets of sequences to infer their evolutionary relationships. Despite the importance of a protein's structure and conformational dynamics to its function and thus its fitness, common phylogenetic methods embody minimal biophysical knowledge of proteins. To underscore the biophysical constraints on natural selection, we survey effects of protein mutations, highlighting the physical basis for marginal stability of natural globular proteins and how requirement for kinetic stability and avoidance of misfolding and misinteractions might have affected protein evolution. The biophysical underpinnings of these effects have been addressed by models with an explicit coarse-grained spatial representation of the polypeptide chain. Sequence–structure mappings based on such models are powerful conceptual tools that rationalize mutational robustness, evolvability, epistasis, promiscuous function performed by ‘hidden’ conformational states, resolution of adaptive conflicts and conformational switches in the evolution from one protein fold to another. Recently, protein biophysics has been applied to derive more accurate evolutionary accounts of sequence data. Methods have also been developed to exploit sequence-based evolutionary information to predict biophysical behaviours of proteins. The success of these approaches demonstrates a deep synergy between the fields of protein biophysics and protein evolution.},

Recent research assumes that RSA is the main determinant of sequence divergence. However, it is not yet clear which is the best predictor of substitution rates. To address this issue, we compared RSA and LPD with site-specific rates of evolution for a diverse data set of enzymes. In contrast with recent studies, we found that LPD measures correlate better than RSA with evolutionary rate. Moreover, the independent contribution of RSA is minor. Taking into account that LPD is related to backbone flexibility, we put forward the possibility that the rate of evolution of a site is determined by the ease with which the backbone deforms to accommodate mutations.},

We have developed a set of simple and physically motivated criteria for secondary structure, programmed as a pattern-recognition process of hydrogen-bonded and geometrical features extracted from x-ray coordinates. Cooperative secondary structure is recognized as repeats of the elementary hydrogen-bonding patterns “turn” and “bridge.” Repeating turns are “helices,” repeating bridges are “ladders,” connected ladders are “sheets.” Geometric structure is defined in terms of the concepts torsion and curvature of differential geometry. Local chain “chirality” is the torsional handedness of four consecutive Cα positions and is positive for right-handed helices and negative for ideal twisted β-sheets. Curved pieces are defined as “bends.” Solvent “exposure” is given as the number of water molecules in possible contact with a residue. The end result is a compilation of the primary structure, including SS bonds, secondary structure, and solvent exposure of 62 different globular proteins. The presentation is in linear form: strip graphs for an overall view and strip tables for the details of each of 10.925 residues. The dictionary is also available in computer-readable form for protein structure prediction work.},

It is generally accepted that proteins must be able to fold stably in order to function. However, the relationship between stability constraints and among-sites rate variation is not well understood. Here, we present a biophysical model that links the thermodynamic stability changes due to mutations at sites in proteins (ΔΔG) to the rate at which mutations accumulate at those sites over evolutionary time. We find that such a "stability model" generally performs well, displaying correlations between predicted and empirically observed rates of up to 0.75 for some proteins. We further find that our model has comparable predictive power as does an alternative, recently proposed "stress model" that explains evolutionary-rate variation among sites in terms of the excess energy needed for mutants to adopt the correct active structure (ΔΔG*). The two models make distinct predictions, though, and for some proteins the stability model outperforms the stress model and vice versa. We conclude that both stability and stress constrain site-specific sequence evolution in proteins.},

	abstract = {The degree to which an amino acid site is free to vary is strongly dependent on its structural and functional importance. An amino acid that plays an essential role is unlikely to change over evolutionary time. Hence, the evolutionary rate at an amino acid site is indicative of how conserved this site is and, in turn, allows evaluation of its importance in maintaining the structure/function of the protein. When using probabilistic methods for site-specific rate inference, few alternatives are possible. In this study we use simulations to compare the maximum-likelihood and Bayesian paradigms. We study the dependence of inference accuracy on such parameters as number of sequences, branch lengths, the shape of the rate distribution, and sequence length. We also study the possibility of simultaneously estimating branch lengths and site-specific rates. Our results show that a Bayesian approach is superior to maximum-likelihood under a wide range of conditions, indicating that the prior that is incorporated into the Bayesian computation significantly improves performance. We show that when branch lengths are unknown, it is better first to estimate branch lengths and then to estimate site-specific rates. This procedure was found to be superior to estimating both the branch lengths and site-specific rates simultaneously. Finally, we illustrate the difference between maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods when analyzing site-conservation for the apoptosis regulator protein Bcl-xL.},

	abstract = {We have carried out a comprehensive analysis of the determinants of human influenza A H3 hemagglutinin evolution, considering three distinct predictors of evolutionary variation at individual sites: solvent accessibility (as a proxy for protein fold stability and/or conservation), experimental epitope sites (as a proxy for host immune bias), and proximity to the receptor-binding region (as a proxy for protein function). We have found that these three predictors individually explain approximately 15\% of the variation in site-wise dN/dS. However, the sol- vent accessibility and proximity predictors seem largely independent of each other, while the epitope sites are not. In combination, solvent accessibility and proximity explain 32\% of the variation in dN/dS. Incorporating experimental epitope sites into the model adds only an additional 2 percentage points. We have also found that the historical H3 epitope sites, which date back to the 1980s and 1990s, show only weak overlap with the latest experimental epitope data, and we have defined a novel set of four epitope groups which are experimentally supported and cluster in 3D space. Finally, sites with dN/dS {\textgreater} 1, i.e., the sites most likely driving seasonal immune escape, are not correctly predicted by either historical or experimental epitope sites, but only by proximity to the receptor-binding region. In summary, proximity to the receptor-binding region, rather than host immune bias, seems to be the primary determinant of H3 immune-escape evolution.},

Although it has long been known that an abundance of nonpolar residues in transmembrane helices is the principal criterion for membrane insertion, the specific sequence-coding for transmembrane helices has not been identified. By challenging the endoplasmic reticulum Sec61 translocon with an extensive set of designed polypeptide segments, we have determined the basic features of this code, including a ‘biological’ hydrophobicity scale. We find that membrane insertion depends strongly on the position of polar residues within transmembrane segments, adding a new dimension to the problem of predicting transmembrane helices from amino acid sequences.

	abstract = {A program is described for drawing the van der Waal's surface of a protein molecule. An extension of the program permits the accessibility of atoms, or groups of atoms, to solvent or solute molecules of specified size to be quantitatively assessed. As defined in this study, the accessibility is proportional to surface area. The accessibility of all atoms in the twenty common amino acids in model tripeptides of the type Ala-X-Ala are given for defined conformation. The accessibilities are also given for all atoms in ribonuclease-S, lysozyme and myogoblin. Internal cavities are defined and discussed. Various summaries of these data are provided. Forty to fifty per cent of the surface area of each protein is occupied by non-polar atoms. The actual numerical results are sensitive to the values chosen for the van der Waal's radii of the various groups. Since there is uncertainty over the correct values for these radii, the derived numbers should only be used as a qualitative guide at this stage. The average change in accessibility for the atoms of all three proteins in going from a hypothetical extended chain to the folded conformation of the native protein is about a factor of 3. This number applies to both polar (nitrogen and oxygen) and non-polar (carbon and sulfur) atoms considered separately. The larger non-polar amino acids tend to be more “buried” in the native form of all three proteins. However, for all classes and for residues within a given class the accessibility changes on folding tend to be highly variable.},

We observe that the flexibility of a given residue is strongly influenced by the solvent accessibility of the adjacent neighbors. The mean normalized B-factor of the exposed residues with two buried neighbors is smaller than that of the buried residues with two exposed neighbors. Inclusion of {RSA} of the neighboring residues (local {RSA)} significantly increases correlation with the B-factor. Correlation between the local {RSA} and B-factor is shown to be stronger than the correlation that considers local distance- or volume-based residue depth. We also found that the correlation coefficients between B-factor and {RSA} for the 20 amino acids, called flexibility-exposure correlation index, are strongly correlated with the stability scale that characterizes the average contributions of each amino acid to the folding stability. Our results reveal that the predicted {RSA} could be used to distinguish between the disordered and ordered residues and that the inclusion of local predicted {RSA} values helps providing a better contrast between these two types of residues. Prediction models developed based on local actual {RSA} and local predicted {RSA} show similar or better results in the context of B-factor and disorder predictions when compared with several existing approaches.

The protein contributes the structure necessary for function. We formulate a model that is based on experiments, insights from the physics of glass-forming liquids, and the concepts of a hierarchically organized energy landscape. To explore the effect of external fluctuations on protein dynamics, we measure the fluctuations in the bulk solvent and the hydration shell with broadband dielectric spectroscopy and compare them with internal fluctuations measured with the Mössbauer effect and neutron scattering. The result is clear. Large-scale protein motions are slaved to the fluctuations in the bulk solvent. They are controlled by the solvent viscosity, and are absent in a solid environment. Internal protein motions are slaved to the beta fluctuations of the hydration shell, are controlled by hydration, and are absent in a dehydrated protein. The model quantitatively predicts the rapid increase of the mean-square displacement above ≈200 K, shows that the external beta fluctuations determine the temperature- and time-dependence of the passage of carbon monoxide through myoglobin, and explains the nonexponential time dependence of the protein relaxation after photodissociation.},

	abstract = {Abstract
Proteins experience a wide variety of conformational dynamics that can be crucial for facilitating their diverse functions. How is the intrinsic flexibility required for these motions encoded in their three-dimensional structures? Here, the overall flexibility of a protein is demonstrated to be tightly coupled to the total amount of surface area buried within its fold. A simple proxy for this, the relative solvent-accessible surface area (Arel), therefore shows excellent agreement with independent measures of global protein flexibility derived from various experimental and computational methods. Application of Arel on a large scale demonstrates its utility by revealing unique sequence and structural properties associated with intrinsic flexibility. In particular, flexibility as measured by Arel shows little correspondence with intrinsic disorder, but instead tends to be associated with multiple domains and increased α-helical structure. Furthermore, the apparent flexibility of monomeric proteins is found to be useful for identifying quaternary-structure errors in published crystal structures. There is also a strong tendency for the crystal structures of more flexible proteins to be solved to lower resolutions. Finally, local solvent accessibility is shown to be a primary determinant of local residue flexibility. Overall, this work provides both fundamental mechanistic insight into the origin of protein flexibility and a simple, practical method for predicting flexibility from protein structures.},

(1) The formation of α-helices and β-pleated sheets from an extended chain buries a greater proportion of polar surface than non-polar and gives 2 to 3 kcal/mol of hydrophobic free energy per residue.
2.
(2) The surfaces buried between the secondary structures are very hydrophobic: being two-thirds non-polar and having more than half the polar part formed by groups that hydrogen bond within their own piece of secondary structure, or which are partially accessible to the solvent.
3.
(3) As the six proteins increase in molecular weight they bury an increasing proportion of their non-polar surface (60 to 79\%), but a constant proportion of their polar surface (75\%).


The implications of these results for the theory of protein structure are discussed.

In the Appendix it is shown that the accessible surface area of folded proteins is simply proportional to the two-thirds power of their molecular weight.},

The As of these proteins can be determined to within 1 to 2 \% and that of their individual residues to within 10 to 20\%.

The As values of proteins are correlated with their molecular weight (Mr) in the range 4000 to 35,000: the power law As = 6.3 M0.73 predicts protein As values to within 4\% on average. The average water-accessible surface is found to be 57\% non-polar, 24\% polar and 19\% charged, with 5\% root-mean-square variations. The molecular surface buried inside the protein is 58\% non-polar, 39\% polar and 4\% charged. The buried surface contains more uncharged polar groups (mostly peptides) than the surface that remains accessible, but many fewer charged groups.

On average, 15\% of residues in small proteins and 32\% in larger ones may be classed as “buried residues”, having less than 5\% of their surface accessible to the solvent. The accessibilities of most other residues are evenly distributed in the range 5 to 50\%. Although the fraction of buried residues increases with molecular weight, the amino acid compositions of the protein interior and surface show no systematic variation with molecular weight, except for small proteins that are often very rich in buried cysteines.

From amino acid compositions of protein surfaces and interiors we calculate an effective coefficient of partition for each type of residue, and derive an implied set of transfer free energy values. This is compared with other sets of partition coefficients derived directly from experimental data. The extent to which groups of residues (charged, polar and non-polar) are buried within proteins correlates well with their hydrophobicity derived from amino acid transfer experiments. Within these three groups, the correlation is low.},

	abstract = {The neutral theory of molecular evolution predicts that variation within species is inversely related to the strength of purifying selection, but the strength of purifying selection itself must be related to physical constraints imposed by protein folding and function. In this paper, we analyzed five enzymes for which polymorphic sequence variation within Escherichia coli and/or Salmonella enterica was available, along with a protein structure. Single and multivariate logistic regression models are presented that evaluate amino acid size, physicochemical properties, solvent accessibility, and secondary structure as predictors of polymorphism. A model that contains a positive coefficient of association between polymorphism and solvent accessibility and separate intercepts for each secondary-structure element is sufficient to explain the observed variation in polymorphism between sites. The model predicts an increase in the probability of amino acid polymorphism with increasing solvent accessibility for each protein regardless of physicochemical properties, secondary-structure element, or size of the amino acid. This result, when compared with the distribution of synonymous polymorphism, which shows no association with solvent accessibility, suggests a strong decrease in purifying selection with increasing solvent accessibility.},

	abstract = {The determinants of site-to-site variability in the rate of amino acid replacement in α/β-barrel enzyme structures are investigated. Of 125 available α/β-barrel structures, only 25 meet a variety of phylogenetic and statistical criteria necessary to ensure sufficient data for reliable analysis. These 25 enzyme structures (from a wide variety of taxa with diverse lifestyles in diverse habitats) differ greatly in size, number, and topology of domains in addition to the α/β-barrel, quaternary structure, metabolic role, reaction catalyzed, presence of prosthetic groups, regulatory mechanisms, use of cofactors, and catalytic mechanisms. Yet, with the exception of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase, all structures have similar frequency distributions of amino acid replacement rates. Hence, site-specific variability in rates of evolution is largely independent of differences in biology, biochemistry, and molecular structure.
A correlation between site-specific rate variation and (1) distance from the active site, (2) solvent accessibility, and (3) treating glycines in unusual main-chain conformations as a separate class, explains approximately half the causal variation. Secondary structure exerts little influence on the pattern and distribution of replacements. Additional domains and subunits, side-chain hydrogen bonds, unusual side-chain rotamers, nonplanar peptide bonds, strained main-chain conformations, and buried hydrophilic-charged residues contribute little to variability among sites because they are rare. Nonlinear models do not improve the fits. In several enzymes, deviations from the typical pattern of replacements suggest the possible action of natural selection. A statistical analysis shows that, in all cases, much of the remaining unexplained variation is not attributable to chance and that other, as yet unidentified, causal relations must exist.},

Here, we aim to develop a mathematical model that can reproduce this linear relationship. We first demonstrate that two models that both seem reasonable choices (a simple model in which selection strength correlates with {RSA} and a more complex model based on {RSA-dependent} amino acid distributions) fail to reproduce the observed relationship. We then develop a model on the basis of observed site-specific amino acid distributions and show that this model behaves appropriately. We conclude that evolutionary rates are directly linked to the distribution of amino acids at individual sites. Because of this link, any future insight into the biophysical mechanisms that determine amino acid distributions will improve our understanding of evolutionary rates.},

	abstract = {We present a novel method to identify sites under selection in protein-coding genes. Our method combines the traditional {Goldman–Yang} model of coding-sequence evolution with the information obtained from the {3D} structure of the evolving protein, specifically the relative solvent accessibility ({RSA)} of individual residues. We develop a random-effects likelihood sites model in which rate classes are {RSA} dependent. The {RSA} dependence is modeled with linear functions. We demonstrate that our {RSA-dependent} model provides a significantly better fit to molecular sequence data than does a traditional, {RSA-independent} model. We further show that our model provides a natural, {RSA-dependent} neutral baseline for the evolutionary rate ratio ω = {dN/dS} Sites that deviate from this neutral baseline likely experience selection pressure for function. We apply our method to the influenza proteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. For hemagglutinin, our method recovers positively selected sites near the sialic acid-binding site and negatively selected sites that may be important for trimerization. For neuraminidase, our method recovers the oseltamivir resistance site and otherwise suggests that few sites deviate from the neutral baseline. Our method is broadly applicable to any protein sequences for which structural data are available or can be obtained via homology modeling or threading.},

	abstract = {We investigate how a protein's structure influences the rate at which its sequence evolves. Our basic hypothesis is that proteins with highly designable structures (structures that are encoded by many sequences) will evolve more rapidly. Recent theoretical advances argue that structures with a higher density of interresidue contacts are more designable, and we show that high contact density is correlated with an increased rate of sequence evolution in yeast. In addition, we investigate the correlations between the rate of sequence evolution and several other structural descriptors, carefully controlling for the strong effect of expression level on evolutionary rate. Overall, we find that the structural descriptors that we consider appear to explain roughly 10\% of the variation in rates of protein evolution in yeast. We also show that despite the well-known trend for buried residues to be more conserved, proteins with a higher fraction of buried residues, nonetheless, tend to evolve their sequences more rapidly. We suggest that this effect is due to the increased designability of structures with more buried residues. Our results provide evidence that protein structure plays an important role in shaping the rate of sequence evolution and provide evidence to support recent theoretical advances linking structural designability to contact density.},

	abstract = {It has recently been shown that in proteins the atomic mean-square displacement (or B-factor) can be related to the number of the neighboring atoms (or protein contact number), and that this relationship allows one to compute the B-factor profiles directly from protein contact number. This method, referred to as the protein contact model, is appealing, since it requires neither trajectory integration nor matrix diagonalization. As a result, the protein contact model can be applied to very large proteins and can be implemented as a high-throughput computational tool to compute atomic fluctuations in proteins. Here, we show that this relationship can be further refined to that between the atomic mean-square displacement and the weighted protein contact-number, the weight being the square of the reciprocal distance between the contacting pair. In addition, we show that this relationship can be utilized to compute the cross-correlation of atomic motion (the B-factor is essentially the auto-correlation of atomic motion). For a nonhomologous dataset comprising 972 high-resolution X-ray protein structures (resolution {\textless}2.0 Å and sequence identity {\textless}25\%), the mean correlation coefficient between the X-ray and computed B-factors based on the weighted protein contact-number model is 0.61, which is better than those of the original contact-number model (0.51) and other methods. We also show that the computed correlation maps based on the weighted contact-number model are globally similar to those computed through normal model analysis for some selected cases. Our results underscore the relationship between protein dynamics and protein packing. We believe that our method will be useful in the study of the protein structure-dynamics relationship.

	abstract = {Elastic network models (ENMs) are entropic models that have demonstrated in many previous studies their abilities to capture overall the important internal motions, with comparisons having been made against crystallographic B-factors and NMR conformational variabilities. ENMs have become an increasingly important tool and have been widely used to comprehend protein dynamics, function, and even conformational changes. However, reliance upon an arbitrary cutoff distance to delimit the range of interactions has presented a drawback for these models, because the optimal cutoff values can differ somewhat from protein to protein and can lead to quirks such as some shuffling in the order of the normal modes when applied to structures that differ only slightly. Here, we have replaced the requirement for a cutoff distance and introduced the more physical concept of inverse power dependence for the interactions, with a set of elastic network models that are parameter-free, with the distance cutoff removed. For small fluctuations about the native forms, the power dependence is the inverse square, but for larger deformations, the power dependence may become inverse 6th or 7th power. These models maintain and enhance the simplicity and generality of the original ENMs, and at the same time yield better predictions of crystallographic B-factors (both isotropic and anisotropic) and of the directions of conformational transitions. Thus, these parameter-free ENMs can be models of choice whenever elastic network models are used.},

Here, packing refers to the set of all pairs of atoms in the molecule. Among all methods developed to assess three-dimensional models, statistical potentials are subject both to praise for their power of discrimination, and to criticism for the weaknesses of their theoretical foundations. Classical derivations of pairwise potentials assume statistical independence of all pairs of atoms. This assumption, however, is not valid in general. We show that we can filter the list of all interactions in a protein to generate a much smaller subset of pairs that retains most of the structural information contained in proteins. The filter is based on a geometric method called alpha shapes that captures the packing in a conformation. Statistical scoring functions derived from such subsets perform as well as scoring functions derived from the set of all pairwise interactions.},

	abstract = {Elastic network models (ENM) are based on the idea that the geometry of a protein structure provides enough information for computing its fluctuations around its equilibrium conformation. This geometry is represented as an elastic network (EN) that is, a network of links between residues. A spring is associated with each of these links. The normal modes of the protein are then identified with the normal modes of the corresponding network of springs. Standard approaches for generating ENs rely on a cutoff distance. There is no consensus on how to choose this cutoff. In this work, we propose instead to filter the set of all residue pairs in a protein using the concept of alpha shapes. The main alpha shape we considered is based on the Delaunay triangulation of the Cα positions; we referred to the corresponding EN as EN(∞). We have shown that heterogeneous anisotropic network models, called αHANMs, that are based on EN(∞) reproduce experimental B-factors very well, with correlation coefficients above 0.99 and root-mean-square deviations below 0.1 Å2 for a large set of high resolution protein structures. The construction of EN(∞) is simple to implement and may be used automatically for generating ENs for all types of ENMs. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

A simplex classification scheme is introduced in which simplices are divided into five classes based on the relative positions of vertex residues in the protein primary sequence.

	abstract = {The concept of amino acid solvent exposure is crucial for understanding and predicting various aspects of protein structure and function. The traditional measures of solvent exposure however suffer from various shortcomings, like for example the inability to distinguish exposed, partly exposed, buried, and deeply buried residues. This article introduces a new measure of solvent exposure called Half-Sphere Exposure that addresses many of the shortcomings of other methods. The new measure outperforms other measures with respect to correlation with protein stability, conservation among fold homologs, amino acid-type dependency and interpretation. The measure consists of the number of Cα atoms in two half spheres around a residue's Cα atom. Conceptually, one of the half spheres corresponds to the side chain's neighborhood, the other half sphere being in the opposite direction. We show here that the two half spheres correspond to two regions around an amino acid that are surprisingly distinct in terms of geometry and energy. This aspect of protein structure introduced here forms the basis of the Half-Sphere Exposure measure. The results strongly suggest that in many respects, a 2D measure is inherently much better suited to describe solvent exposure than the traditional 1D measures. Importantly, Half-Sphere Exposure can be calculated from the Cα atom coordinates only, which abolishes the need for a full-atom model to calculate solvent exposure. Hence, the measure can be used in protein structure prediction methods that are based on various simplified models. Half-Sphere Exposure has great potential for use in protein structure prediction and analysis. Proteins 2005. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

It is commonly assumed that the key structural determinant of site-specific rates of evolution is the Relative Solvent Accessibility (RSA). However, a recent study found that amino acid substitution rates correlate better with two Local Packing Density (LPD) measures, the Weighted Contact Number (WCN) and the Contact Number (CN), than with RSA. This work aims at a more thorough assessment. To this end, in addition to substitution rates, we considered four other sequence variability scores, four measures of solvent accessibility (SA), and other CN measures. We compared all properties for each protein of a structurally and functionally diverse representative dataset of monomeric enzymes. We show that the best sequence variability measures take into account phylogenetic tree topology. More importantly, we show that both LPD measures (WCN and CN) correlate better than all of the SA measures, regardless of the sequence variability score used. Moreover, the independent contribution of the best LPD measure is approximately four times larger than that of the best SA measure. This study strongly supports the conclusion that a site\&\#x2019;s packing density rather than its solvent accessibility is the main structural determinant of its rate of evolution.},

Although these properties are inherently quantitative, structure-based studies of protein evolution tend to rely upon coarse distinctions between “surface” and “buried” residues and between “interfacial” and “noninterfacial” residues. Using homology-mapped yeast protein structures, we explore the relationships between residue evolution and continuous structural properties of the residue microenvironment, including solvent accessibility, density and distribution of residue–residue contacts, and burial depth. We confirm the role of solvent exposure as a major structural determinant of residue evolution and also identify a weak secondary effect arising from packing density. The relationship between solvent exposure and evolutionary rate (dN/dS) is found to be strong, positive, and linear. This reinforces the notion that residue burial is a continuous property with quantitative fitness implications. Next, we demonstrate systematic variation in residue-level structure–evolution relationships resulting from changes in global physical and biological contexts. We find that increasing protein-core size yields a more rapid relaxation of selective constraint as solvent exposure increases, although solvent-excluded residues remain similarly constrained. Finally, we analyze the selective constraint in protein–protein interfaces, revealing two fundamentally different yet separable components: continuous structural constraint that scales with total residue burial and a more surprising fixed functional constraint that accompanies any degree of interface involvement. These discoveries serve to elucidate and unite structure–evolution relationships at the residue and whole-protein levels.},

	abstract = {Following the general procedure of Bernal \&amp; Finney (1967) using Voronoi polyhedra, volumes occupied by all the atoms, or groups of atoms, in lysozyme and ribonuclease S have been estimated from the atomic co-ordinates provided by crystal structure studies. The average packing density for the interior of both proteins is close to 0.75, which is in the middle of the range found for crystals of most small organic molecules. For all atom types the mean packing densities fall between 0.7 and 0.8 with standard deviations between ± 0.1 and ± 0.2. It is suggested that simple geometrical packing considerations may provide useful criteria in guiding and evaluating trial structures in theoretical studies of protein folding, especially the association of distant parts of a peptide chain.

Packing densities averaged over a relatively small number of atoms (5 to 15) appear to vary substantially in different parts of the same protein. Low densities representing packing defects may permit relatively easy motions, for example in an active site. Surrounding areas of high density may serve as relatively incompressible regions which transmit or correlate motions over considerable distances.

The total volume of each of these two proteins as derived from the co-ordinate list appears to be larger than that estimated from the partial specific volume by 7 to 10\%. If this volume difference is attributed to a change in the packing of water in a monolayer surrounding the protein, it would correspond to an average decrease, relative to bulk water, of 1 to 2 Å3 per water molecule in this monolayer. Such a change is about half of the decrease that occurs on the melting of ice.},

We go beyond average densities, and look at the full distribution functions of free volumes inside proteins.

Although proteins look like organic crystals by the criterion of average density, they look more like liquids and glasses by the criterion of their free volume distributions. The distributions are broad, and the scalings of volume-to-surface, volume-to-cluster-radius, and numbers of void versus volume show that the interiors of proteins are more like randomly packed spheres near their percolation threshold than like jigsaw puzzles. We find that larger proteins are packed more loosely than smaller proteins. And we find that the enthalpies of folding (per amino acid) are independent of the packing density of a protein, indicating that van der Waals interactions are not a dominant component of the folding forces.},

The variation of the whole core is very small (∼2·5\%) compared to the variation at individual sites (∼ 13\%). However, by comparing our results to those expected from random sequences with no correlations between sites,, we show that the small variation observed may simply be a manifestation of the statistical “law of large numbers” and not reflect any compensating changes in, or global constraints upon, protein sequences.

We have also analysed in detail the volume variations at individual sites, both in the core and on the surface, and compared these variations with those expected from random sequences. Individual sites on the surface have nearly the same variation as random sequences (24\% versus 28\% variation). However, individual sites in the core have about half the variation of random sequences (13\% versus 30\%). Roughly, half of these core sites strongly conserve their volume (0 to 10\% variation): one quarter have moderate variation (10 to 20\%): and the remaining quarter vary randomly (20 to 40\%).

Our results have clear implications for the relationship between protein sequence and structure. For our analysis, we have developed a new and simple method for weighting protein sequences to correct for unequal representation, which we describe in an Appendix.},

	abstract = {Structural flexibility is an essential attribute, without which few proteins could carry out their biological functions. Much information about protein flexibility has come from x-ray crystallography, in the form of atomic mean-square displacements (AMSDs) or B factors. Profiles showing the AMSD variation along the polypeptide chain are usually interpreted in dynamical terms but are ultimately governed by the local features of a highly complex energy landscape. Here, we bypass this complexity by showing that the AMSD profile is essentially determined by spatial variations in local packing density. On the basis of elementary statistical mechanics and generic features of atomic distributions in proteins, we predict a direct inverse proportionality between the AMSD and the contact density, i.e., the number of noncovalent neighbor atoms within a local region of ∼1.5 nm3 volume. Testing this local density model against a set of high-quality crystal structures of 38 nonhomologous proteins, we find that it accurately and consistently reproduces the prominent peaks in the AMSD profile and even captures minor features, such as the periodic AMSD variation within α helices. The predicted rigidifying effect of crystal contacts also agrees with experimental data. With regard to accuracy and computational efficiency, the model is clearly superior to its predecessors. The quantitative link between flexibility and packing density found here implies that AMSDs provide little independent information beyond that contained in the mean atomic coordinates.},

In this paper, we analyzed five enzymes for which polymorphic sequence variation within Escherichia coli and/or Salmonella enterica was available, along with a protein structure. Single and multivariate logistic regression models are presented that evaluate amino acid size, physicochemical properties, solvent accessibility, and secondary structure as predictors of polymorphism. A model that contains a positive coefficient of association between polymorphism and solvent accessibility and separate intercepts for each secondary-structure element is sufficient to explain the observed variation in polymorphism between sites. The model predicts an increase in the probability of amino acid polymorphism with increasing solvent accessibility for each protein regardless of physicochemical properties, secondary-structure element, or size of the amino acid. This result, when compared with the distribution of synonymous polymorphism, which shows no association with solvent accessibility, suggests a strong decrease in purifying selection with increasing solvent accessibility.},

By modeling the selective constraint on several amino acid properties, we show that although residue volume and hydropathy are strongly conserved across most alignments, there is little variation in interior versus surface conservation for these two properties. By contrast, residue charge (isoelectric point) is less generally conserved when considering the protein as a whole but shows a strong constraint against the introduction of charged residues into the protein interior.},

	abstract = {Several recent works have shown that protein structure can predict site-specific evolutionary sequence variation. In particular, sites that are buried and/or have many contacts with other sites in a structure have been shown to evolve more slowly, on average, than surface sites with few contacts. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the extent to which numerous structural properties can predict sequence variation. The quantities we considered include buriedness (as measured by relative solvent accessibility), packing density (as measured by contact number), structural flexibility (as measured by B factors, root-mean-square fluctuations, and variation in dihedral angles), and variability in designed structures. We obtained structural flexibility measures both from molecular dynamics simulations performed on nine non-homologous viral protein structures and from variation in homologous variants of those proteins, where they were available. We obtained measures of variability in designed structures from flexible-backbone design in the Rosetta software. We found that most of the structural properties correlate with site variation in the majority of structures, though the correlations are generally weak (correlation coefficients of 0.1–0.4). Moreover, we found that buriedness and packing density were better predictors of evolutionary variation than structural flexibility. Finally, variability in designed structures was a weaker predictor of evolutionary variability than buriedness or packing density, but it was comparable in its predictive power to the best structural flexibility measures. We conclude that simple measures of buriedness and packing density are better predictors of evolutionary variation than the more complicated predictors obtained from dynamic simulations, ensembles of homologous structures, or computational protein design.},

	abstract = {The relative solvent accessibility (RSA) of a residue in a protein measures the extent of burial or exposure of that residue in the 3D structure. RSA is frequently used to describe a protein's biophysical or evolutionary properties. To calculate RSA, a residue's solvent accessibility (ASA) needs to be normalized by a suitable reference value for the given amino acid; several normalization scales have previously been proposed. However, these scales do not provide tight upper bounds on ASA values frequently observed in empirical crystal structures. Instead, they underestimate the largest allowed ASA values, by up to 20\%. As a result, many empirical crystal structures contain residues that seem to have RSA values in excess of one. Here, we derive a new normalization scale that does provide a tight upper bound on observed ASA values. We pursue two complementary strategies, one based on extensive analysis of empirical structures and one based on systematic enumeration of biophysically allowed tripeptides. Both approaches yield congruent results that consistently exceed published values. We conclude that previously published ASA normalization values were too small, primarily because the conformations that maximize ASA had not been correctly identified. As an application of our results, we show that empirically derived hydrophobicity scales are sensitive to accurate RSA calculation, and we derive new hydrophobicity scales that show increased correlation with experimentally measured scales.},

The conservation of a residue in a family is defined as the average residue similarity in a given position of aligned sequences. The residue similarities were expressed in the form of log-odd substitution tables that take into account the environments of amino acids in three-dimensional structures. The protein core is defined as those residues that have less then 7\% solvent accessibility. The density of a protein core is described in terms of atom packing, which is investigated as a criterion for residue substitution and conservation. Although there is no significant correlation between sequence conservation and average atom packing around nonpolar residues such as leucine, valine and isoleucine, a significant correlation is observed for polar residues in the protein core. This may be explained by the hydrogen bonds in which polar residues are involved; the better their protection from water access the more stable should be the structure in that position.

For the accompanying aggregate set of 130 alignments, a strong linear correlation is observed between the calculated sequence entropy and the corresponding inverse packing density determined at an associated residue position. This region of linearity spans the range of Cα packing densities from 12 to 25 amino acids within a sphere of 9 Å radius. Three different hydrophobicity scales all mimic the behavior of the sequence entropies. This confirms the idea that the ability to accommodate mutations is strongly dependent on the available space and on the propensity for each amino acid type to be buried.

By comparing rates within HA subtypes among host species, we derive an upper limit to the amount of variation that can be explained by structural constraints of any kind. Protein structure explains only 20–40\% of the variation in ω. Finally, by comparing ω at sites near the sialic-acid-binding region to ω at other sites, we show that ω near the sialic-acid-binding region is significantly elevated in both human and avian influenza, with the exception of avian H5. We conclude that protein structure, HA subtype, and host biology all impose distinct selection pressures on sites in influenza HA.},

We compare S and VS, a related measure, in detail with VK, the traditional measure of immunoglobulin sequence variability, both in the abstract and as applied to the immunoglobulins. We conclude that S has desirable mathematical properties that VK lacks and has intuitive and statistical meanings that accord well with the notion of variability. We find that VK and the S-based measures are highly correlated for the immunoglobulins. We show by analysis of sequence data and by means of a mathematical model that this correlation is due to a strong tendency for the frequency of occurrence of amino acid types at a given position to be log-linear. It is not known whether the immunoglobulins are typical or atypical of protein families in this regard, nor is the origin of the observed rank-frequency distribution obvious, although we discuss several possible etiologies.},

	abstract = {It has recently been shown that in proteins the atomic mean-square displacement (or B-factor) can be related to the number of the neighboring atoms (or protein contact number), and that this relationship allows one to compute the B-factor profiles directly from protein contact number. This method, referred to as the protein contact model, is appealing, since it requires neither trajectory integration nor matrix diagonalization. As a result, the protein contact model can be applied to very large proteins and can be implemented as a high-throughput computational tool to compute atomic fluctuations in proteins. Here, we show that this relationship can be further refined to that between the atomic mean-square displacement and the weighted protein contact-number, the weight being the square of the reciprocal distance between the contacting pair. In addition, we show that this relationship can be utilized to compute the cross-correlation of atomic motion (the B-factor is essentially the auto-correlation of atomic motion). For a nonhomologous dataset comprising 972 high-resolution X-ray protein structures (resolution {\textless}2.0 Å and sequence identity {\textless}25\%), the mean correlation coefficient between the X-ray and computed B-factors based on the weighted protein contact-number model is 0.61, which is better than those of the original contact-number model (0.51) and other methods. We also show that the computed correlation maps based on the weighted contact-number model are globally similar to those computed through normal model analysis for some selected cases. Our results underscore the relationship between protein dynamics and protein packing. We believe that our method will be useful in the study of the protein structure-dynamics relationship.

Structural dynamics emerged in recent years as another essential aspect of protein functionality. Structural dynamics enable the adaptation of the protein to binding substrates and to undergo allosteric transitions, while maintaining the native fold. Key residues that mediate structural dynamics would thus be expected to be conserved or exhibit coevolutionary patterns at least. Yet, the correlation between sequence evolution and structural dynamics is yet to be established. With recent advances in efficient characterization of structural dynamics, we are now in a position to perform a systematic analysis. In the present study, a set of 34 enzymes representing various folds and functional classes is analyzed using information theory and elastic network models. Our analysis shows that the structural regions distinguished by their coevolution propensity as well as high mobility are predisposed to serve as substrate recognition sites, whereas residues acting as global hinges during collective dynamics are often supported by conserved residues. We propose a mobility scale for different types of amino acids, which tends to vary inversely with amino acid conservation. Our findings suggest the balance between physical adaptability (enabled by structure-encoded motions) and chemical specificity (conferred by correlated amino acid substitutions) underlies the selection of a relatively small set of versatile folds by proteins.},

We develop a random-effects likelihood sites model in which rate classes are RSA dependent. The RSA dependence is modeled with linear functions. We demonstrate that our RSA-dependent model provides a significantly better fit to molecular sequence data than does a traditional, RSA-independent model. We further show that our model provides a natural, RSA-dependent neutral baseline for the evolutionary rate ratio ω = dN/dS Sites that deviate from this neutral baseline likely experience selection pressure for function. We apply our method to the influenza proteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. For hemagglutinin, our method recovers positively selected sites near the sialic acid-binding site and negatively selected sites that may be important for trimerization. For neuraminidase, our method recovers the oseltamivir resistance site and otherwise suggests that few sites deviate from the neutral baseline.

Our basic hypothesis is that proteins with highly designable structures (structures that are encoded by many sequences) will evolve more rapidly. Recent theoretical advances argue that structures with a higher density of interresidue contacts are more designable, and we show that high contact density is correlated with an increased rate of sequence evolution in yeast. In addition, we investigate the correlations between the rate of sequence evolution and several other structural descriptors, carefully controlling for the strong effect of expression level on evolutionary rate. Overall, we find that the structural descriptors that we consider appear to explain roughly 10\% of the variation in rates of protein evolution in yeast. We also show that despite the well-known trend for buried residues to be more conserved, proteins with a higher fraction of buried residues, nonetheless, tend to evolve their sequences more rapidly. We suggest that this effect is due to the increased designability of structures with more buried residues. Our results provide evidence that protein structure plays an important role in shaping the rate of sequence evolution and provide evidence to support recent theoretical advances linking structural designability to contact density.},

Despite the importance of a protein's structure and conformational dynamics to its function and thus its fitness, common phylogenetic methods embody minimal biophysical knowledge of proteins. To underscore the biophysical constraints on natural selection, we survey effects of protein mutations, highlighting the physical basis for marginal stability of natural globular proteins and how requirement for kinetic stability and avoidance of misfolding and misinteractions might have affected protein evolution. The biophysical underpinnings of these effects have been addressed by models with an explicit coarse-grained spatial representation of the polypeptide chain. Sequence–structure mappings based on such models are powerful conceptual tools that rationalize mutational robustness, evolvability, epistasis, promiscuous function performed by ‘hidden’ conformational states, resolution of adaptive conflicts and conformational switches in the evolution from one protein fold to another. Recently, protein biophysics has been applied to derive more accurate evolutionary accounts of sequence data. Methods have also been developed to exploit sequence-based evolutionary information to predict biophysical behaviours of proteins. The success of these approaches demonstrates a deep synergy between the fields of protein biophysics and protein evolution.},

Relative solvent accessibility (RSA) and local packing density (LPD) have emerged as the best candidates to quantify structural constraint. Recent research assumes that RSA is the main determinant of sequence divergence. However, it is not yet clear which is the best predictor of substitution rates. To address this issue, we compared RSA and LPD with site-specific rates of evolution for a diverse data set of enzymes. In contrast with recent studies, we found that LPD measures correlate better than RSA with evolutionary rate. Moreover, the independent contribution of RSA is minor. Taking into account that LPD is related to backbone flexibility, we put forward the possibility that the rate of evolution of a site is determined by the ease with which the backbone deforms to accommodate mutations.},

We have developed a set of simple and physically motivated criteria for secondary structure, programmed as a pattern-recognition process of hydrogen-bonded and geometrical features extracted from x-ray coordinates. Cooperative secondary structure is recognized as repeats of the elementary hydrogen-bonding patterns “turn” and “bridge.” Repeating turns are “helices,” repeating bridges are “ladders,” connected ladders are “sheets.” Geometric structure is defined in terms of the concepts torsion and curvature of differential geometry. Local chain “chirality” is the torsional handedness of four consecutive Cα positions and is positive for right-handed helices and negative for ideal twisted β-sheets. Curved pieces are defined as “bends.” Solvent “exposure” is given as the number of water molecules in possible contact with a residue. The end result is a compilation of the primary structure, including SS bonds, secondary structure, and solvent exposure of 62 different globular proteins. The presentation is in linear form: strip graphs for an overall view and strip tables for the details of each of 10.925 residues.

It is generally accepted that proteins must be able to fold stably in order to function. However, the relationship between stability constraints and among-sites rate variation is not well understood. Here, we present a biophysical model that links the thermodynamic stability changes due to mutations at sites in proteins (ΔΔG) to the rate at which mutations accumulate at those sites over evolutionary time. We find that such a "stability model" generally performs well, displaying correlations between predicted and empirically observed rates of up to 0.75 for some proteins. We further find that our model has comparable predictive power as does an alternative, recently proposed "stress model" that explains evolutionary-rate variation among sites in terms of the excess energy needed for mutants to adopt the correct active structure (ΔΔG*). The two models make distinct predictions, though, and for some proteins the stability model outperforms the stress model and vice versa. We conclude that both stability and stress constrain site-specific sequence evolution in proteins.},

We also examined the effect of the number of homologues included in an alignment.

An amino acid that plays an essential role is unlikely to change over evolutionary time. Hence, the evolutionary rate at an amino acid site is indicative of how conserved this site is and, in turn, allows evaluation of its importance in maintaining the structure/function of the protein. When using probabilistic methods for site-specific rate inference, few alternatives are possible. In this study we use simulations to compare the maximum-likelihood and Bayesian paradigms. We study the dependence of inference accuracy on such parameters as number of sequences, branch lengths, the shape of the rate distribution, and sequence length. We also study the possibility of simultaneously estimating branch lengths and site-specific rates. Our results show that a Bayesian approach is superior to maximum-likelihood under a wide range of conditions, indicating that the prior that is incorporated into the Bayesian computation significantly improves performance. We show that when branch lengths are unknown, it is better first to estimate branch lengths and then to estimate site-specific rates. This procedure was found to be superior to estimating both the branch lengths and site-specific rates simultaneously. Finally, we illustrate the difference between maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods when analyzing site-conservation for the apoptosis regulator protein Bcl-xL.},

We have found that these three predictors individually explain approximately 15\% of the variation in site-wise dN/dS. However, the sol- vent accessibility and proximity predictors seem largely independent of each other, while the epitope sites are not. In combination, solvent accessibility and proximity explain 32\% of the variation in dN/dS. Incorporating experimental epitope sites into the model adds only an additional 2 percentage points. We have also found that the historical H3 epitope sites, which date back to the 1980s and 1990s, show only weak overlap with the latest experimental epitope data, and we have defined a novel set of four epitope groups which are experimentally supported and cluster in 3D space. Finally, sites with dN/dS {\textgreater} 1, i.e., the sites most likely driving seasonal immune escape, are not correctly predicted by either historical or experimental epitope sites, but only by proximity to the receptor-binding region. In summary, proximity to the receptor-binding region, rather than host immune bias, seems to be the primary determinant of H3 immune-escape evolution.},

	abstract = {Protein structural fluctuation, typically measured by Debye-Waller factors, or B-factors, is a manifestation of protein flexibility, which strongly correlates to protein function. The flexibility-rigidity index (FRI) is a newly proposed method for the construction of atomic rigidity functions required in the theory of continuum elasticity with atomic rigidity, which is a new multiscale formalism for describing excessively large biomolecular systems. The FRI method analyzes protein rigidity and flexibility and is capable of predicting protein B-factors without resorting to matrix diagonalization. A fundamental assumption used in the FRI is that protein structures are uniquely determined by various internal and external interactions, while the protein functions, such as stability and flexibility, are solely determined by the structure. As such, one can predict protein flexibility without resorting to the protein interaction Hamiltonian. Consequently, bypassing the matrix diagonalization, the original FRI has a computational complexity of O ( N 2 ) . This work introduces a fast FRI (fFRI) algorithm for the flexibility analysis of large macromolecules. The proposed fFRI further reduces the computational complexity to O ( N ) . Additionally, we propose anisotropic FRI (aFRI) algorithms for the analysis of protein collective dynamics. The aFRI algorithms permit adaptive Hessian matrices, from a completely global 3N × 3N matrix to completely local 3 × 3 matrices. These 3 × 3 matrices, despite being calculated locally, also contain non-local correlation information. Eigenvectors obtained from the proposed aFRI algorithms are able to demonstrate collective motions. Moreover, we investigate the performance of FRI by employing four families of radial basis correlation functions. Both parameter optimized and parameter-free FRI methods are explored. Furthermore, we compare the accuracy and efficiency of FRI with some established approaches to flexibility analysis, namely, normal mode analysis and Gaussian network model (GNM). The accuracy of the FRI method is tested using four sets of proteins, three sets of relatively small-, medium-, and large-sized structures and an extended set of 365 proteins. A fifth set of proteins is used to compare the efficiency of the FRI, fFRI, aFRI, and GNM methods. Intensive validation and comparison indicate that the FRI, particularly the fFRI, is orders of magnitude more efficient and about 10\% more accurate overall than some of the most popular methods in the field. The proposed fFRI is able to predict B-factors for α-carbons of the HIV virus capsid (313 236 residues) in less than 30 seconds on a single processor using only one core. Finally, we demonstrate the application of FRI and aFRI to protein domain analysis.},

	abstract = {Naturally evolving proteins gradually accumulate mutations while continuing to fold to stable structures. This process of neutral evolution is an important mode of genetic change and forms the basis for the molecular clock. We present a mathematical theory that predicts the number of accumulated mutations, the index of dispersion, and the distribution of stabilities in an evolving protein population from knowledge of the stability effects (ΔΔG values) for single mutations. Our theory quantitatively describes how neutral evolution leads to marginally stable proteins and provides formulas for calculating how fluctuations in stability can overdisperse the molecular clock. It also shows that the structural influences on the rate of sequence evolution observed in earlier simulations can be calculated using just the single-mutation ΔΔG values. We consider both the case when the product of the population size and mutation rate is small and the case when this product is large, and show that in the latter case the proteins evolve excess mutational robustness that is manifested by extra stability and an increase in the rate of sequence evolution. All our theoretical predictions are confirmed by simulations with lattice proteins. Our work provides a mathematical foundation for understanding how protein biophysics shapes the process of evolution.},

Hence, a continuous assignment is proposed. Technically, the continuum results from averaging over ten discrete DSSP assignments with different hydrogen bond thresholds. The final continuous assignment for a single NMR model successfully reflected the structural variations observed between all NMR models in the ensemble. The structural variations between NMR models were verified to correlate with thermal motion; these variations were captured by the continuous assignments. Because the continuous assignment reproduces the structural variation between many NMR models from one single model, functionally important variation can be extracted from a single X-ray structure. Thus, continuous assignments of secondary structure may affect future protein structure analysis, comparison, and prediction.},

Theory is limited to the essentials required to comprehend issues of quality. There is an extensive reference section and suggestions for further reading for those who wish to delve deeper.

The second part 'Practice' gives more information about the procedures employed in the course of crystal structure determination. The emphasis is on the quality measures of X-ray diffraction analysis to give the reader a critical insight into the quality and accuracy of a structure determination and to enable the reader to appreciate which parts of a structure determination may have caused special difficulty. There is no pretence of completeness and many matters discussed in standard crystallography texts are deliberately omitted.

In most previous studies, these models were validated by comparing calculated atomic fluctuations for isolated proteins with experimental temperature factors determined in the crystalline state, although there were also hints that including crystal contacts in the calculations has an impact on the comparison. In this study, a set of 83 ultra-high resolution crystal structures with experimentally determined anisotropic displacement parameters is used to evaluate several Cα-based elastic network models that either ignore or treat the crystal environment in different ways; the latter include using periodic boundary conditions defined with respect to the asymmetric unit or the primitive unit cell as well as using the Born-von Kármán boundary condition that accounts for lattice vibrations. For all elastic network models, treating the crystal environment leads to better agreement with experimental anisotropic displacement parameters with the Born-von Kármán boundary condition giving the best agreement. Atomic correlations over the entire protein are clearly affected by the presence of the crystal contacts and fairly sensitive to the way that the crystal environment is treated. These observations highlight the importance of properly treating the protein system in an environment consistent with experiment when either evaluating approximate protein models or using approximate dynamic models in structural refinement application types. Finally, investigation of the scaling behaviors of the cumulative density of states and the heat capacity indicates that there are still gaps between simplified elastic models and all-atom models for proteins.},

When the ionic separation is greater than the phonon wavelength appropriate to the transition energy Δ (i.e., when λ{\textgreater}hνsΔ, where νs is the sound velocity), the coupling due to transverse phonons falls off very slowly, ∼(Δℏνt)2[cos(rjj′Δℏνt)]rjj′, where νt is the transverse sound velocity, a result similar to that of McMahon and Silsbee.

At the same time, a midpoint line is printed that corresponds to the grand average of the hydropathy of the amino acid compositions found in most of the sequenced proteins. In the case of soluble, globular proteins there is a remarkable correspondence between the interior portions of their sequence and the regions appearing on the hydrophobic side of the midpoint line, as well as the exterior portions and the regions on the hydrophilic side. The correlation was demonstrated by comparisons between the plotted values and known structures determined by crystallography. In the case of membrane-bound proteins, the portions of their sequences that are located within the lipid bilayer are also clearly delineated by large uninterrupted areas on the hydrophobic side of the midpoint line. As such, the membrane-spanning segments of these proteins can be identified by this procedure. Although the method is not unique and embodies principles that have long been appreciated, its simplicity and its graphic nature make it a very useful tool for the evaluation of protein structures.},

	abstract = {Theoretical studies have suggested relationships between the size, stability and topology of a protein fold and the rate and mechanisms by which it is achieved. The recent characterization of the refolding of a number of simple, single domain proteins has provided a means of testing these assertions. Our investigations have revealed statistically significant correlations between the average sequence separation between contacting residues in the native state and the rate and transition state placement of folding for a non-homologous set of simple, single domain proteins. These indicate that proteins featuring primarily sequence-local contacts tend to fold more rapidly and exhibit less compact folding transition states than those characterized by more non-local interactions. No significant relationship is apparent between protein length and folding rates, but a weak correlation is observed between length and the fraction of solvent-exposed surface area buried in the transition state. Anticipated strong relationships between equilibrium folding free energy and folding kinetics, or between chemical denaturant and temperature dependence-derived measures of transition state placement, are not apparent. The observed correlations are consistent with a model of protein folding in which the size and stability of the polypeptide segments organized in the transition state are largely independent of protein length, but are related to the topological complexity of the native state. The correlation between topological complexity and folding rates may reflect chain entropy contributions to the folding barrier.},

The models include linear regression, two-class logistic regression, and multinomial regression problems while the penalties include ℓ1 (the lasso), ℓ2 (ridge regression) and mixtures of the two (the elastic net). The algorithms use cyclical coordinate descent, computed along a regularization path. The methods can handle large problems and can also deal efficiently with sparse features. In comparative timings we find that the new algorithms are considerably faster than competing methods.},

The core functionality of FoldX, namely the calculation of the free energy of a macromolecule based on its high-resolution 3D structure, is now publicly available through a web server at http://foldx.embl.de/. The current release allows the calculation of the stability of a protein, calculation of the positions of the protons and the prediction of water bridges, prediction of metal binding sites and the analysis of the free energy of complex formation. Alanine scanning, the systematic truncation of side chains to alanine, is also included. In addition, some reporting functions have been added, and it is now possible to print both the atomic interaction networks that constitute the protein, print the structural and energetic details of the interactions per atom or per residue, as well as generate a general quality report of the pdb structure. This core functionality will be further extended as more FoldX applications are developed.},

High resolution structures provide insights into the functional mechanisms of membrane proteins, but detailed biophysical characterization of membrane proteins is difficult. Complementary to experimental techniques, molecular dynamics simulations is a powerful tool in providing more complete description of the dynamics and energetics of membrane proteins with high spatial-temporal resolution. In this chapter, we provide a survey of the current methods and technique issues for setting up and running simulations of membrane proteins. The recent progress in applying simulations to understanding various biophysical properties of membrane proteins is outlined.},
