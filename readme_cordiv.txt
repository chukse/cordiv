    This folder contains data and analysis for finding the potential variables that create the observed diversity in the correlations of the structural variables with sequence entropy, for example, the wide range of correlations observed in RSA-seqent or WCN-seqent among different proteins.

    The directory 'structures', contains all repaired pdb structures in the data set of Echave 2014 (Yeh et al.).

    The directory 'properties', contains the pdb-level & residue-level properties of all pdb structures, each in a single file.

    Info about directory phylip_alignments :
    These alignments are taken from the work of Echave, Jackson, Wilke (2014).
    They are here for the purpose of finding the number of alignments for each protein strcuture, to investigate whther the number of sequences in the alignment has an effect on the strength of sequence-structure correlations.
