This folder contains data and analysis for finding the potential variables that create the observed diversity in the correlations of the structural variables with sequence entropy, for example, the wide range of correlations observed in RSA-seqent or WCN-seqent among different proteins.

The directory 'structures', contains all repaired pdb structures in the data set of Echave 2014 (Yeh et al.).
