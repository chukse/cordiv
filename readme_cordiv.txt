This folder contains data and analysis for finding the potential variables that create the observed diversity in the correlations of the structural variables with sequence entropy, for example, the wide range of correlations observed in RSA-seqent or WCN-seqent among different proteins.

The directory 'structures', contains all repaired pdb structures in the data set of Echave 2014 (Yeh et al.).

The directory 'pdb_prop', contains the pdb-level properties of all pdb structures, each in a single file.

The directory 'rl_pdb_prop', contains the residue-level properties of the pdb files, each in a separate file corresponding to the pdb structure.
