	UPDATE:
		The maps have been updated based on the new alignment data by Stephanie (data in folder evolutionary_rates).
		

Amir Shahmoradi, Wilke Lab., University of Texas Austin, 5:45 PM Friday July 25, 2013.

This folder contains the mappings between the pdb residues and the corresponding sites in Stephanie's sequence alignment files.

The filename format is: <name of the alignment (abbreviation, not the same as Stephanie's naming, c.f., readme.txt in the repositorry's root directory)> + <name of the pdb file>.map
