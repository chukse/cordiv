    This folder contains data and analysis for finding the potential variables that create the observed diversity in the correlations of the structural variables with sequence entropy, for example, the wide range of correlations observed in RSA-seqent or WCN-seqent among different proteins.

Contents/

    structures/ 
    	contains all repaired pdb structures in the data set of Echave et al 2014

    properties/
    	contains the pdb-level & residue-level properties of all pdb structures, each in a single file.

	ddG_calculations/
		contains all of the files, scripts, and resulting data from the FoldX ddG calculations
	
	rate_calculations/
		contains all of the files, scripts, and resulting data from the rate4site evolutionary rate calculations
