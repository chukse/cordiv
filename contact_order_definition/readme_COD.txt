Goal: 
        Write a code that calculates the Contact order for each residue of a given PDB file according to its original definition by Plaxco et al. (1998).
        and to inverstigate which cutoff value for the contacting residues is the best.
        For now, I am giong to stop working on this idea and first calculate the original definition of contact orders for each PDB file and see if those have any explanatory power for the diversity of the observed correlations.
